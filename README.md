##  Why I Built This

Because sometimes you just need a simple reminder tool in your terminal—no database, no web UI, no setup.  
I wanted to keep it light and focused:

- Learn how Python lists and user choice loops work.
- Follow a clean, PEP 8–style structure.
- Make something I can run in seconds on any computer.
